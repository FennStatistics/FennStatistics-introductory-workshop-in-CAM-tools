## Write a sensational press release of Cognitive-Affective Maps


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Revolutionary Cognitive-Affective Maps Empower People to Transform the Way they Think and Feel

A revolutionary new technology is transforming the way people think and feel. Cognitive-Affective Maps (CAMs) are a groundbreaking new tool that can help people better understand and manage their emotions and thoughts.

CAMs are based on the principles of cognitive science and use powerful visualizations to show how individual thoughts and emotions can interact and influence each other. By providing an intuitive way for people to understand their own mental processes, CAMs can help individuals to better recognize and manage their own emotions, helping to reduce stress, improve well-being, and increase productivity.

CAMs can be used to explore the root causes of negative thinking, identify potential solutions to problems, and develop plans for long-term well-being. The technology is also being used to support mental health professionals in their work with individuals who are struggling with mental health issues.

CAMs are being used by individuals, organizations, and businesses around the world to improve their quality of life. With its intuitive and powerful interface, CAMs are revolutionizing the way people think and feel. For more information about Cognitive ...

## What are the potentials of Cognitive Affective Maps?


Cognitive Affective Maps (CAMs) have several potential benefits in the field of cognitive psychology and neuroscience:
1. Understanding the relationship between cognition and emotion: CAMs provide a framework for studying the complex interplay between cognitive processes (such as perception, attention, memory, and decision-making) and emotions.
2. Explaining emotional regulation: CAMs can help to explain how emotions are regulated and controlled through cognitive processes, such as attention and working memory.
3. Improving decision-making: CAMs can be used to study how emotions influence decision-making and can provide insights into how decision-making can be improved through emotional regulation.
4. Understanding the role of emotions in motivation: CAMs can help to explain the role of emotions in motivation and how emotions can drive behavior and action.
5. Improving our understanding of mental disorders: CAMs can be used to study the relationship between cognition, emotion, and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, and provide insights into how these disorders can be treated.

It's important to note that CAMs are just one of several approaches to understanding the relationship between cognition and emotion, and their potential benefits should be evaluated in light of the limitations and criticisms of the framework. Additionally, **further empirical research is needed to fully understand and validate the predictions made by CAMs***.

## our CAM team (a subset)

<center>
<img src="images/wordcloud.jpg", height="450px">
</center>

> especially without [Lisa's disseration](https://www.psychologie.uni-freiburg.de/Members/lreuter/Reuterdiss) we would be at a completely different stage of research / CAM tools development





> without Florian I would not have been able to program the CAM tools



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->

## CAMs I

CAMs as a quantitative and qualitative research method first became popular through [Paul Thagard](https://paulthagard.com/); possible to identify and visually represent any kind of declarative knowledge:


<center>
<img src="images/CAM_example.jpg", height="450px">
</center>


`r Citet(bib, c("sendtner_kostbare_2021", "thagard_empathica_2010"))`


<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## CAMs II - theory

**What are CAMs?**

* CAMs are „conceptual structures that people use to represent important aspects of the world“
* „cognitive-affective map is a visual representation of the emotion values of a group of interconnected concepts“
  + this is how CAMs differ from semantic networks, because CAMs additionally contain emotions (valence)
  + hot cognition: emotions cannot be separated from cognitions
  
<br>
<br> 

**How are CAMs constructed?**

* the stepwise construction process of CAMs can be understood as a **multiple constraint satisfaction process**, where concepts, conditions, goals, etc. are mentally represented with the involvement of emotions
  + Concepts in the CAM are only changed or added if they correspond to the „most coherent account of what we want to understand“

<br>

`r Citet(bib, c("thagard_coherence_2000", "thagard_hot_2006", "thagard_cognitive_2021"))`





<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## CAMs III - fields of application

* to study if CAMs are supplementary to questionnaires -  `r Citet(bib, c("mansell_novel_2021", "mansell_measuring_2021"))`
* agent-based modelling - e.g. `r Citet(bib, c("wolf_changing_2015", "schroder_modeling_2017"))`
* use CAMs for conflict mediation - e.g. `r Citet(bib, c("gros_camediaid_2021"))`
* evaluate via CAMs the success of an intervention - e.g. `r Citet(bib, c("reuter_leisure_2021", "luthardt_and_2020"))`
* ...

<br>
<br>
-> super interesting article with a pure methodological focus on CAMs, especially on network similarity: `r Citet(bib, c("luthardt_quantifying_2022"))`; methodological perspective developed by [Jonathan Morgan](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=HKo8keYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) who proposed measures to compute
* network similarity for CAMs
* concept association similarity
* affective similarity
* (generating random networks based on existing CAM data)




<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## CAMs IV - fundamental hypothesis 

**Hypothesis**: The generation process of CAMs is not arbitrary, but is determined by multiple processes at multiple levels, and thus CAMs from similar individuals on an identical topic exhibit systematic correlations (similar data generating process)

* can be presented by a „emergent product of interaction between networks of mental representations at the individual level and networks of social communication at the group level“


<center>
<img src="images/fundamentalHypothesis.jpg", height="250px">
</center>


> if stochasticity is ubiquitous in **complex networks**, these networks are not maximally random either; rather, they obey organization principles that make them functional

* ...



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->

## personal recommendations for future studies

To assess (emerging) technologies I came up with the following recommendations:

* in the preparation phase of a study **content-wise** it is necessary to
  + conduct systematic literature reviews to develop strong theoretical models, because every technology is driven by different factors (like hedonistic vs. societal aspects are more important -> iPhone vs. nuclear power plant)
  +	conduct (qualitative) pre-studies to understand how laypersons understand specific terms like sustainability
  +	work within an multi- / inter- / transdisciplinary team to set up materials for a study and to understand the needs of different actors. This process should be supported by promoters and a clear strategy

<br>

* Acceptance of emerging technologies involves a multi-dimensional, dynamic process and the involvement of different perspectives; therefore, we need **methodological**
  +	high reliable measurements (of acceptance, ...)
  +	complex designs (longitudinal, multi-group, ...); sophisticated experimental designs, because correlative designs are not sufficient to understand „cause-and-effect relationships“
  +	combine different sources of data (data blending)
  +	have enough power (N) to:
    1. use latent modelling approaches (using Bayesian framework)
    2. do latent class / cluster analysis
    3. approaches which not assuming linearity (machine learning)

## Side-Note: Valence Data was cleaned

Valence data is prepossessed to  solve the following problems:

* Ghost nodes: These are concepts (node) that are not connected to any other concepts in the CAM (i.e. do not form the smallest possible network consisting of two concepts).
  + these are deleted
* Multiple connections: In Valence it is technically possible to draw multiple connections between concepts. This leads to a complex network (multigraph) instead of a simple network.
  + all multiple connections except for the last one drawn are deleted
* Unconnected networks: Valence does not force participants to connect all concepts into one large network and this results in multiple components (network parts).
  + all components except the largest are deleted, if there are two (or more) components of the same size, a component is selected at random

## Take-Home Message

* meta analytical perspective can be used to
  + check the influence of **CAM study design** on all kinds of network indicators
  + check the influence of **specified restrictions** (possible in C.A.M.E.L.) on all kinds of network indicators


<br>
preliminary findings: 

* the DGP of CAMs is sensitive to the study design
* the DGP of CAMs is sensitive to specified restrictions
  + floor effects (e.g. when forcing participants to draw X concepts) can limit the interpretability of certain network indicators
  + however, it results in larger CAMs


<br>
<br>
pairs of highly correlated network indicators do not need to be included in a **latent structure** identification algorithm

## latent structure of CAMs

assuming the **fundamental hypothesis** (see slide 12) is true, the generation process of CAMs is not arbitrary, but bey organization principles (which could depend on study design, ...) 

<br>
A CAM (graph) is in general defined by: 
$$ G = (V, E)$$
, whereby V = set of vertices, E = set of edges. The vertices also contain emotional information (valence; *hot cognition*, *HOTCO*, ...), which leads to the following network properties:


.pull-left[

**emotional properties**
<br>
measure how the valence of individual nodes contributes to the overall CAM (Average Valence, Percentage of each node type, <span style="color:blue">Central Node Valence</span>, ...)

]

.pull-right[

**latent properties**
<br>
refer to the number of nodes, links, and their interconnectedness (Centrality, Density, Diameter, Number of Nodes, Number of Links, Triadic Closure, ...)

]

> remark: it would also be possible to include position information (x, y) of drawn nodes and number of changes / movements (event log)

## the cooking recipe to identify latent structure(s) of CAMs 

**goal**:
<br>
we are looking for a combination of network indicators, which can 
* (a) differentiate between studies
* (b) identify within persons fluctuations
* (c) identify specific structures within / between studies

<br>
<br>
**how**:
<br>
therefore we need the following:
1. test all possible combination of network indicators
2. compute similarity matrices
3. test, e.g. using hierarchical clustering, the ability of choosen network indicators to allow for (a), (b), (c)
  + to archive this we need some kind of supervised learning


> ! important to note: neural networks or self-organizing maps (techniques of (un)supervised machine learning) can be extremely helpful

Cosine similarity normalizes the inner product with respect to the Euclidean distances of the two vectors, with the distances derived from the square root of the inner product of the vector and itself, A and B

$$\text{similarity} = cos(\theta) = \frac{\textbf{A}*\textbf{B}}{||\textbf{A}|| *||\textbf{B}||}$$

> interpreted as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. When x and y are non-negative numbers, the cosine similarity is bounded between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating perfect similarity

## multilayer networks - structure

A CAM (graph) is in general defined by: 
$$ G = (V, E)$$
Now multilayer networks are defined by:

$$ G = (V, E, D)$$

, whereby D is a set of dimensions (or layers = CAMs). 

<br>
<br>
What could be done (one example):
<br>
**Multi-layer neighbors**
In a multidimensional network, the neighbors of some node v are all nodes connected to v v across dimensions.

## Precondition for such an approach: number of unique concepts need to be lower than X

**Problem:** if too many unique concepts are in a CAM data set the vectors plugged in the cosine similarity measure get to sparse (too many missing values), which leads to problems, which could be partly solved by adjusting the cosine similarity measures (e.g. substracting vector mean); but I would recommend:

**to reduce number of unique concepts**

Following the five-step procedure, the 1063 unique concepts (1473 in total) were reduced to 52 concepts (see detailed list of the 52 concepts in Appendix D in the online supplementary; https://osf.io/8z63x) - see `r Citet(bib, c("fenn_identifying_2022"))`

## Possible Outcome

Similarity Matrix to identify specific subgroups of people within single CAM studies:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 123)
sigma <- matrix(data = 
              c(4,3,3,1,1,1,
                3,4,3,1,1,1,
                3,3,4,1,1,1,
                1,1,1,4,2,1,
                1,1,1,2,4,1,
                1,1,1,1,1,4), ncol=6)
# cov2cor(V = sigma)
simMat <- rmvnorm(n=5000, mean=c(rep(1, times=6)), sigma=sigma)
simMat <- round(x = cor(simMat), digits = 2)
colnames(simMat) <- c(rep("CC TRUE", times=3), rep("CC FALSE", times=2), "the undecided guy")
rownames(simMat) <- c(rep("CC TRUE", times=3), rep("CC FALSE", times=2), "the undecided guy")
```

.pull-left[

**Similarity Matrix**: 

.scrollChunk[
```{r}
simMat
```
]


]
.pull-right[

**Hierarchical Clustering**: 

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.dim = c(12, 6), dpi=600}
cosine_sim <- 1-as.dist(simMat) # create similarity  using euclidean distance
cluster1 <- hclust(cosine_sim, method = "ward.D2") # Ward's method
plot(cluster1)
```
]

> e.g. identify CAMs of people who belief / disbelief in climate change

## side-note: Aggregation

to highlight the inter-relatedness of all summarized concepts, the CAMs between X groups can be  aggregated by creating a so-called *“canonical adjacency matrix”*; example:

## How to implement?

-> acording to `r Citet(bib, c("luthardt_quantifying_2022"))` (methodological perspective developed by [Jonathan Morgan](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=HKo8keYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)) possible measures:
* concept association similarity
* affective similarity
  + need to be compared with randomly generated networks based on CAM data; see also `r Citet(bib, c("mansell_measuring_2021"))`
  
  


-> constructing canonical edge lists for each CAM (list of all observed and possible associations) and generating similarity scores (again cosine similarity) based on these lists

<br>
the challenge would be how to combine latent and emotional properties, see `r Citet(bib, c("mansell_novel_2021", "mansell_measuring_2021"))`

<br>
**principle**

$$\text{if concept}_i \text{ and concept}_j \text{ are related then write in edge list = } 1$$
$$\text{if in edge list = } 1 \text{ then check if concept}_i \text{ and concept}_j \text{ between 2 CAMs have similar valence}$$
