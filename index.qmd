## Overview: Potentials of Cognitive Affective Maps (CAMs)

1. Understanding the relationship between cognition and emotion: CAMs provide a framework for studying the complex interplay between cognitive processes (such as perception, attention, memory, and decision-making) and emotions.

2. Explaining emotional regulation: CAMs can help to explain how emotions are regulated and controlled through cognitive processes, such as attention and working memory.

3. Improving decision-making: CAMs can be used to study how emotions influence decision-making and can provide insights into how decision-making can be improved through emotional regulation.

4. Understanding the role of emotions in motivation: CAMs can help to explain the role of emotions in motivation and how emotions can drive behavior and action.

5. Improving our understanding of mental disorders: CAMs can be used to study the relationship between cognition, emotion, and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, and provide insights into how these disorders can be treated.

It's important to note that CAMs are just one of several approaches to understanding the relationship between cognition and emotion, and their potential benefits should be evaluated in light of the limitations and criticisms of the framework. Additionally, **further empirical research is needed to fully understand and validate the predictions made by CAMs**.

## Overview: CAMs - Introduction

CAMs as a quantitative and qualitative research method first became popular through [Paul Thagard](https://paulthagard.com/); possible to identify and visually represent any kind of declarative knowledge:


![](images/CAM_example.jpg){height=450 fig-align="center"}


`r Citet(bib, c("sendtnerKostbareKistenGrunde2021", "thagardEMPATHICAComputerSupport2010"))`


## Overview: CAMs - Theory

**What are CAMs?**

* CAMs are „conceptual structures that people use to represent important aspects of the world“
* „cognitive-affective map is a visual representation of the emotion values of a group of interconnected concepts“
  + this is how CAMs differ from semantic networks, because CAMs additionally contain emotions (valence)
  + hot cognition: emotions cannot be separated from cognitions

**How are CAMs constructed?**

* the stepwise construction process of CAMs can be understood as a **multiple constraint satisfaction process**, where concepts, conditions, goals, etc. are mentally represented with the involvement of emotions
  + Concepts in the CAM are only changed or added if they correspond to the „most coherent account of what we want to understand“

`r Citet(bib, c("thagardCoherenceThoughtAction2000", "thagardHotThoughtMechanisms2006", "thagardCognitiveScienceCOVID192021"))`


## Overview: CAMs - Fields of Application

* to study if CAMs are supplementary to questionnaires -  `r Citet(bib, c("mansellNovelNetworkApproach2021", "mansellMeasuringAttitudesComplex2021"))`
* agent-based modelling - e.g. `r Citet(bib, c("wolfChangingMindsElectric2015", "schroderModelingMultilevelMechanisms2017"))`
* use CAMs for conflict mediation - e.g. `r Citet(bib, c("grosCAMediaidMultimethodApproach2021"))`
* evaluate via CAMs the success of an intervention - e.g. `r Citet(bib, c("reuterLeisureWalksModulate2021", "luthardtThenWeLl2020"))`
* ...

## Overview: CAMs - Fundamental Hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: The generation process of CAMs is not arbitrary, but is determined by multiple processes at multiple levels, and thus CAMs from similar individuals on an identical topic exhibit systematic correlations (similar data generating process)

* can be presented by a „emergent product of interaction between networks of mental representations at the individual level and networks of social communication at the group level“

![](images/fundamentalHypothesis.jpg){height=250 fig-align="center"}

> if stochasticity is ubiquitous in **complex networks**, these networks are not maximally random either; rather, they obey organization principles that make them functional

`r Citet(bib, c("bianconiMultilayerNetworksStructure2018", "homer-dixonComplexSystemsApproach2013"))`

> a short excursion into the world of distributions



## DGP: Stochastic Process of DGP of CAMs

Data generation process (DGP): When [...] data set has been created, a good model has to be constructed for the data generation process. This is the stage at which the actual [...] analysis begins... When an [...] model has been constructed for the DGP, it should **only be used for the analysis if it reflects the ongoings in the system of interest properly**

> a model should make a parsimonious, plausible and substantially meaningful contribution to the data generation process


>  in statistics, we assume that we can represent the DGP by discrete and continuous (univariate, multivariate, mixture of) distributions

## Current Work
By analyzing the content of CAMs

* CAMs offer added value compared to a survey, as the latter can only consider pre-identified influential factors
* CAMs allow to identify similar concerns as more time consuming interview / focus group based  methods - [Fenn, et al. (accepted revision)](#bib1); `r Citet(bib, c("reuter_direct_2022"))`
* ...

<br>

by using CAMs for experimental and correlation studies 
* CAMs have been used for intervention, e.g. mediation `r Citet(bib, c("gros_camediaid_2021"))` or cost intervention `r Citet(bib, c("sendtner_kostbare_2021"))`
* correlations between CAMs’ emotional properties and latent properties and survey scales - `r Citet(bib, c("mansell_measuring_2021", "mansell_novel_2021"))`

## adaptive designs

e.g. by sending the CAM JSON object between components of a study (e.g. session data capabilities of JATOS) it is possible to set up adaptive designs, e.g. for intervention studies: 

![](images/interventionDesign.jpg){height=300 fig-align="center"}

> possible to implement sequential collaboration (event file is created)


and to analyze the CAM data in real-time to adaptively ask questions using [Cytoscape.js](<https://js.cytoscape.org/>)

## CAM-App - Structure of CAM Data

A CAM (graph) is in general defined by: 
$$ G = (V, E)$$
, whereby V = set of vertices, E = set of edges. The vertices also contain emotional information (valence; *hot cognition*, *HOTCO*, ...), which leads to the following network properties:


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

**emotional properties**
<br>
measure how the valence of individual nodes contributes to the overall CAM (Average Valence, Percentage of each node type, <span style="color:blue">Central Node Valence</span>, ...)

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
**latent properties**
<br>
refer to the number of nodes, links, and their interconnectedness (Centrality, Density, Diameter, Number of Nodes, Number of Links, Triadic Closure, ...)

:::

composed of two steps:
<br>
**pre-processing step**

CAM data is often messy and the number of unique concepts drawn is in general quite huge, e.g.

*Following the five-step procedure, the 1063 unique concepts (1473 in total) were reduced to 52 concepts (see detailed list of the 52 concepts in D in the online supplementary; <https://osf.io/vb5qe>)* - [Fenn, et al. (accepted revision)](#bib1)

<br>
<br>
**analysis step**

* word lists / word clouds
* co-occurrence maps
* aggregate CAM
* network indicators
* network similarity (! in development)

> functionalities are based on 31 R functions, Python code divided in 28 modules (server, UI seperated); see: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uiLFD6RnRzv1v-k84p8u8JIua_Kf5TK0KTgGg6Oe5Hg/edit?usp=sharing>


## Pre-Processing: reduce number of unique concepts

* Approximate matching: closeness of two concepts is measured in terms of the number of primitive operations necessary to convert the concept into an exact match (e.g. substitution: coat -> cost)
* Searching terms: using regular expressions

<br>

* Search for synonyms: automatically searching for synonyms in a dictionary (Reverso)
* Apply word2vec model: automatically generating suggestions for clustering and summarizing concepts according to semantic similarity between concepts
  + Categories of words found by word2vec:

![](images/word2vec_example.jpg){height=350, fig-align="center"}

## Pre-Processing: Reliability module

To start the module please click on one of the the module option on the sidebar panel. The options for this module are the following:

* Train Reliability: Here you can create word lists of your concepts, which can be summarized by (independet) raters.
* Get Reliability: Based on multiple summarized wordlists (at least 2) you can compute multiple reliability coefficients.
* Information: Further information regarding this module.

## Analysis: Aggregate CAMs - multilayer networks


Multilayer networks are defined by:

$$ G = (V, E, D)$$

, whereby D is a set of dimensions (or layers = CAMs). 

![](images/multilayerNetworkExample.jpg){height=380 fig-align="center"} 

e.g. `r Citet(bib, c("bianconiMultilayerNetworksStructure2018", "domenicoMultilayerNetworksAnalysis2022"))`


## Analysis:  Aggregated CAM

to highlight the inter-relatedness of all summarized concepts, the CAMs (between X groups) can be aggregated by creating a so-called *“canonical adjacency matrix”*; example of 58 summarized CAMs: 

![](images/aggregatedCAMExample.jpg) {height=450 fig-align="center"}
[Fenn, et al. (accepted revision)](#bib1)



## Analysis: Slice CAMs


*If you have a CAM structure, which can be separated (e.g. pre-defined opposing concepts) the CAMs can be automatically sliced according to two possible criteria: (a) delete a connection between two concepts, or (b) delete a concept. Automatically the CAM changed this way is checked according to multiple criteria (e.g. number of expected network components) to validate the slicing process.*
